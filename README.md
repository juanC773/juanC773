💻 Full Stack Developer with a strong emphasis on **Frontend**

## 🧠 About Me
I enjoy working on projects where frontend is not just about visuals,  
but is tightly integrated with well-structured backends, solid databases,  
and real deployment workflows (CI/CD, containers, cloud).

I have experience building full stack systems, working with DevOps practices,  
and developing projects related to **data analysis and artificial intelligence**.
